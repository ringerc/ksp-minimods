{
    // The inflatible heat shield is magic, to the point where you never need
    // anything else once you have it. Nerf it a bit. It needs higher temp
    // tolerance on the skin than the ablative shields do because it doesn't
    // have pyrolisis for cooling.
    //
    // It should be useful for things like Duna landings, but lethal on Eve
    // or Jool for anything but high grazing of the atmosphere.
    //
    // One possible issue will be KSP's lack of decent "thin" atmo on dense
    // planets.
    //
    // This is rather less tuned so far, but it's shown survivable for Kerbin
    // high passes at 4500m/s
    //
