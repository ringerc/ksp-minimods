# Micro-mods for Kerbal Space Program (KSP)

A collection of ModuleManager-only patches I wrote for KSP.
Like those in [the forum thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139980-130-community-database-of-module-manager-patches-for-stock-ksp/),
but I can't stand working without revision control.

You can just copy these directories or the raw .cfg files into your `GameData`
directory to use them.

To use these mods you must have [`ModuleManager`] installed. There must be a
ModuleManager dll in your game data directory. It's bundled with most if not all
mods, so you should have it. If not, get it from
[here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-141-module-manager-307-may-5th-2018-its-dangerous-to-go-alone-take-those-cats-with-you/).

If you edit the config files or add/remove some, you can reload them without
restarting KSP. Go to the space center and press Alt-F11 (RShift-F11 on Linux),
then choose "Reload database" from he resulting menu. Wait until the reload
completes before doing anything.
